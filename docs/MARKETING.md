# Marketing Materials — mcp-gitlab-server

**Goal:** Position as #1 GitLab MCP implementation by June 2026.

## HackerNews Launch Post (DRAFT)

**Title:** `Show HN: GitLab MCP Server with 86 tools (vs competitors' 10-20)`

**Post:**

We built the most comprehensive Model Context Protocol server for GitLab — 86 tools covering everything from basic repo access to CI/CD pipelines, wiki management, and security scanning.

**Why this matters:**

Most GitLab MCP implementations have 10-20 tools and cover only basic operations. We went deeper:

- **86 tools** vs competitors' 10-20
- **Full CI/CD pipeline management** (list, trigger, retry, cancel + job logs)
- **Wiki with attachments** (project + group wikis)
- **Protected branch management**
- **Member & permission management**
- **Active development** (latest PR Feb 2026 vs stale repos)

**What's next:**

- v0.4.0 (Mar 1): Revolutionary feature (Jira sync, AI changelog gen, or CI viz)
- v0.5.0 (Mar 31): Enterprise features (SAML, audit logs, HA setup)
- Goal: 500+ stars by June, become the industry standard

**MIT licensed**, production-ready, actively maintained.

## Twitter/LinkedIn Post (Thread)

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
🚀 We built the most comprehensive GitLab MCP server — 86 tools vs competitors' 10-20.

Full CI/CD, wikis, protected branches, member mgmt — everything you need for production AI workflows.

MIT licensed, actively maintained.

🧵 Why it matters 👇

**Tweet 2 (Problem):**
Most GitLab MCP implementations are basic: read repos, create issues, maybe MRs.

But production AI workflows need:
✅ CI/CD pipeline control
✅ Wiki management
✅ Security scanning
✅ Member permissions
✅ Protected branches

**Tweet 3 (Solution):**
We built 86 tools covering the full GitLab API:

• Repository ops (search, create, fork, archive)
• File CRUD with branch support
• Full MR lifecycle (create, review, approve, merge)
• CI/CD pipelines + job logs
• Wiki with attachments
• Protected branch rules

**Tweet 4 (Differentiation):**
vs. Competitors:

| Feature | Us | Others |
|---------|----|----|
| Tools | 86 | 10-20 |
| CI/CD | ✅ Full | ⚠️ Basic/missing |
| Wiki | ✅ + attachments | ⚠️ Limited |
| Active dev | ✅ Feb 2026 | ❌ Stale |

**Tweet 5 (Roadmap):**
Coming soon:

📅 v0.4.0 (Mar 1): Revolutionary feature (Jira sync, AI changelog, or CI viz)
📅 v0.5.0 (Mar 31): Enterprise (SAML, audit, HA)

🎯 Goal: #1 GitLab MCP by June 2026

Vision: https://github.com/yoda-digital/mcp-gitlab-server/wiki/Product-Vision-&-Roadmap

**Tweet 6 (CTA):**
Try it:
```
npm install @yoda.digital/gitlab-mcp-server
```

Built for enterprise AI workflows, not just basic API access.

## Reddit r/ClaudeAI / r/LocalLLaMA Post

**Title:** `[Tool] GitLab MCP Server with 86 tools — most comprehensive implementation`

**Post:**

I've been frustrated with existing GitLab MCP servers — they cover basic operations (read repos, create issues) but nothing production-grade.

So we built a comprehensive one: **86 tools** covering the full GitLab API.

**What's included:**

- Full CI/CD pipeline management (list, trigger, retry, cancel pipelines + job logs)
- Wiki management with attachments (project + group wikis)
- Protected branch rules
- Member & permission management
- Repository operations (search, create, fork, archive)
- Complete MR lifecycle (create, review, approve, merge with diff support)
- File CRUD with branch support
- Labels, milestones, events

**vs. Competitors:**

Most GitLab MCP implementations have 10-20 tools and focus on read-only operations. We went deeper with 86 tools covering write operations, CI/CD, and enterprise features.

| Feature | This Server | Typical Competitor |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Total Tools | 86 | 10-20 |
| CI/CD | ✅ Full pipeline mgmt | ⚠️ Basic/missing |
| Wiki | ✅ With attachments | ⚠️ Limited |
| Active Dev | ✅ Latest PR Feb 2026 | ❌ Stale repos |

**Roadmap:**

- **v0.4.0 (Mar 1):** Revolutionary feature (Jira sync, AI-powered changelog generation, or CI visualization)
- **v0.5.0 (Mar 31):** Enterprise features (SAML, audit logging, HA setup, performance benchmarks)

**Goal:** Become the #1 GitLab MCP implementation by June 2026 (500+ stars, industry standard).

**Install:**
```bash
npm install @yoda.digital/gitlab-mcp-server
```

**GitHub:** https://github.com/yoda-digital/mcp-gitlab-server
